# The Best README Generator
 
  ## Description
  I made a README Generator.

  To start the generator, run the index.js on node. The user will prompted with questions. After the user has completed answering the prompts, A README file will be saved to the "Develop" folder. There are options to add a license which will add a badge onto the README file. The user also has the option to have no licenses, which will not add a badge to the READMe file. WHen the user adds their Github user name, a link of the the user's github will be added to the README file.

  The generator provides a section for description, installation, usage, contribution, testing, credits, and section with information of how to reach the user. There is also a functional table of contents that links to the respective sections.

  Enjoy.

  ## Credits
  I thought this assignment was fairly straightforward until I had a study group with some of my peers. They helped me realize I was doing a part of the generator incorrectly, so I want to give a lot of credit to my peers.
