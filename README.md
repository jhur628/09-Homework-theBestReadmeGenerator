# README Generator
 
  ## Description
  I made a README Generator.

  To start the generator, run the index.js on node. The user will prompted with questions. After the user has completed answering the prompts, A README file will be saved to the "Develop" folder. There are options to add a license which will add a badge onto the README file. The user also has the option to have no licenses, which will not add a badge to the READMe file. WHen the user adds their Github user name, a link of the the user's github will be added to the README file.
